Problem: Rotate Matrix by 90 Degrees

You are given an  n \times n  matrix (a 2D list in Python) representing an image, where each element represents a pixel’s color in grayscale. Your task is to rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise in place.

Input:

	•	An  n \times n  list matrix of integers, where  1 \leq n \leq 20 .

Output:

	•	Modify the input matrix in place so that it is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

Example:

	matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]

Should rotate to:
[
  [7, 4, 1],
  [8, 5, 2],
  [9, 6, 3]
]
